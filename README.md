**Welcome!**  This is conference for the DataPy  for Women Who code, where we are going to talk about **Data analysis with SQL and Python**. _By Liliana Torres_


Travel into space to learn about the Cassini mission & the Enceladus moon with SQL and Python.

SQLAlchemy is an open-source SQL toolkit and object-relational mapper for the Python programming language released under the MIT License.

Pandas is one of those package that makes importing and analyzing data much easier.

#### Instructions to get the project working locally:

1) You will need to donwload all the files.
2) Installing Database: You can intall postgress app from here: [**Postgress app**](https://postgresapp.com/) You can also use Hombrew, Docker, or built source but postgress app is one of the easier. Or you can download from here [**Postgress**](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

I used docker container to get this database. Here is an article to follow, This can work for windows as well mac [**Docker Instalation**](https://hackernoon.com/dont-install-postgres-docker-pull-postgres-bee20e200198) 

3) After docker, or local set up is completed is set up to can use the make file to create set up the database and get it normalized. you will run that command by going to the folder and through terminal 

  Go to the folder by usind cd command example

  ../user/DataPyCuriousMoon/Database

  `Run make clean && make`

  The above will create all the tables and  the normalize views needed it to look at the data
